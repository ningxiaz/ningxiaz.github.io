						<p>
							<a href="http://techyizu.org" target="_blank">TechYiZu</a> is a group in Shanghai dedicated to growing technology community in China through volunteer-organized events. I was very glad to be invited to one of its major event <a href="http://www.techyizu.org/recap-designing-shanghai-2011/" target="_blank">DesignINg Shanghai UX Day</a>, which was also sponsored by IDEO and Frog Design. It included enlightening talks and a city-wide research and rapid prototyping exercise, all around User Centered Design. In the workshop, I cooperated with 5 other people from different backgrounds (animation, industrial design, fashion, green technology and data mining) to try to come up with a solution to the poor condition of the marriage market in People's Square, Shanghai. The video above is our presentation of our prototype. (The girl who played the role of community organizer is me!)
						</p>
						<p>
							The marriage market is a place where desperate parents gather putting up posters trying to find matches for their children. The efficiency is very poor, as well as the environment. More importantly, it lacks foundation of trust.
						</p>
						<p>
							Faced with all these problems, we firstly got lost in generating a solution. To make parents happy or to improve the marriage rate or to make children happy? Then we settled on to make parents happy. At first, I was not quite convinced since I thought the marriage, at last, was about the children. But later I came to realize that if their parents weren't happy they would not be happy either (this is especially true in China). So how to make parents happy?
						</p>
						<p>
							Then we realized that a community should be organized to take responsibility. The lack of trust, the case of false information could be eliminated by a standard and authorized verification process. People providing personal information can have stamps on their verified documents. Then how to make parents happy, especially those of really successful women? Remember the depression and bad mood there? We should pull out successful stories and make the parents aware that there's hope. In fact, this is a common practice for dating sites and it's also a good idea for offline marriage market. It occurred to me that it's not just encouraging parents, the examples could alter the mindset! Divorced? Women with PhD degrees? No problem they can still be happy together with someone they love. We should make the stories convincing and that would make a difference. We all agreed that this solution would make everyone, parents, children, the whole family happy.

						</p>
						<p>
							We then made a very powerful and interesting presentation telling a story of a successful marriage. At last, it turned out that our presentation was the most impressive among the ten teams.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was the first time I got to know design thinking and I was blown away by its wide application and great potential impacts on the world around us. Talking with the various people attending the event also greatly broadened my views on design, technology, interactivity and innovation. This experience contributes a lot to my decision to come to Stanford (where design thinking was invented) and dedicate to designing for better life experiences with technology in my future career.
