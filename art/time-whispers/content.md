When I think about how to use objects to help me track time, I find that all the things around me suggest me about time in some way: how long ago I last used them, how long they have been with me, how frequent I use them etc. For some objects, they suggest time in a more unique ways, for example, perfume can last a certain period of time, so does the battery of my laptop.

In my mind, people sense the time passing by noticing changes, changes in the environment, changes of ourselves, changes of people around us etc. For long, we’ve been using things that change in a more reliable, and measurable way as the official objects to track time, such as clocks. Actually, in the past we used sun and moon to define year, day and month, and now we use atomic radiation to reach high precision. However, many everyday objects still tell us about time passing with their changes, though the information might not be very accurate. We just don’t usually realize it.
